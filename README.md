The Library Management Project in Java is a software application for efficient management of library resources. It allows librarians to add, update, and remove books from the collection. Members can register and borrow books. The system tracks due dates, manages fines, and sends notifications. It offers search and filtering options for quick access to books and member information. Reports are generated for inventory, member records, overdue books, and transactions. This project automates manual processes, streamlines operations, and improves resource management. It enhances the library experience for both librarians and members.
